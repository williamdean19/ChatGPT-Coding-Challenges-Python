"""ChatGPT:
>> Sure, here's a coding challenge for you:
>> Write a function in Python that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of the two largest numbers in the list.
>> Your function should be named "sum_largest_numbers" and take in one parameter: a list of integers. It should return the sum of the two largest numbers in the list.
>> For example, if the input list is [5, 3, 9, 1, 8], the function should return 17 (which is the sum of 9 and 8, the two largest numbers in the list).
>> Your function should work for lists of any length, including empty lists and lists with only one integer. If the input list has less than two integers, your function should return 0.
>> Please provide your solution and I'll let you know if it's correct. Once you provide your solution, I'll also explain how I would have solved the problem."""

# Solution:
def sum_largest_numbers(myList):  
    if len(myList) < 2:
        return 0
    else:
        myList.sort()
        a = myList.pop(len(myList) - 1)
        b = myList.pop(len(myList) - 1)
        return a+b

print(sum_largest_numbers([1,56,44,32,1245,1,2,3]))

"""ChatGPT:
>> Great! Your solution looks correct and efficient. Your function first checks if the input list has less than two integers and returns 0 if that's the case. 
>> Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order and removes the two largest numbers by popping them from the end of the list. 
>> Finally, it returns the sum of these two largest numbers.
>> Your function will work correctly for all possible input lists and should run in O(nlogn) time complexity due to the sorting operation.
>> Well done!"""

# Will:
# >> Would you consider it cheating to use the sort() algorithm, since that's really the heart of the problem?

"""ChatGPT:
>> Not at all! Using built-in functions or libraries is a common and efficient way to solve problems in programming.
>> Sorting the list using the sort() method is an appropriate and straightforward way to solve this problem. 
>> The key is to understand the problem, identify the appropriate algorithm, and implement it correctly. Your solution does exactly that.
>> In a real-world scenario, you would want to use the built-in sort function or other libraries to solve this problem because it is more efficient and saves development time. 
>> Writing your own sort function may not only take longer to develop but could be less efficient than the built-in sort function."""

# Will:
# >> how would you have solved it

"""ChatGPT:
I would have solved it in a similar way to yours. The problem asks to find the sum of the two largest numbers in a list of integers. 
One way to do this is to sort the list in descending order and then return the sum of the first two elements of the list.
Here's the solution I would have written:
"""
    """python"""

    def sum_largest_numbers(numbers):
        if len(numbers) < 2:
            return 0
        sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)
        return sorted_numbers[0] + sorted_numbers[1]

"""The function first checks if the input list has less than two integers and returns 0 if that's the case. 
Otherwise, it sorts the list in descending order using the sorted() function and the reverse=True argument. 
Then, it returns the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list, which are the two largest numbers in the original list.
This solution also has a time complexity of O(nlogn) because it sorts the input list, which takes O(nlogn) time in the worst case."""
